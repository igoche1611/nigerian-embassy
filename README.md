How to Deploy to GitHub Pages
You can host this website for free using GitHub Pages. Follow these simple steps:

Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository
Sign in to GitHub.

Create a new repository. You can name it whatever you like, for example, nigerian-embassy-prague.

Important: If you want the website to be available at https://<your-username>.github.io/, you must name the repository <your-username>.github.io. Otherwise, it will be at https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/.

Step 2: Upload the Website Files
In your new repository, click the "Add file" button and select "Upload files".

Drag and drop the index.html, 404.html, and this README.md file into the file uploader.

Click "Commit changes".

Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
In your repository, go to the "Settings" tab.

In the left sidebar, click on "Pages".

Under the "Build and deployment" section, for the "Source", select "Deploy from a branch".

Under the "Branch" section, select the main (or master) branch and the /(root) folder.

Click "Save".

Step 4: Your Website is Live!
GitHub will take a minute or two to deploy your site. You will see a green message with the URL of your live website at the top of the GitHub Pages settings. It will look something like this:

https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/

Congratulations! Your professional website is now live.

Making Changes
To update the website, you can edit the files directly on GitHub or upload new versions. Any changes you commit to the main branch will automatically be reflected on the live site.
